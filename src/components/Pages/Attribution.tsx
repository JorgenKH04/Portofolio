          I'd like to thank Web3Forms for providing me with a serverless form
          for my portfolio. Their form is easy to use and customize, and it has
          been a great addition to my site.

          I'd also like to thank Luis Quintero for creating the video animation
          that I'm using in the header of my portfolio. His work is high quality
          and visually appealing, and it has helped to make my portfolio more
          engaging.
